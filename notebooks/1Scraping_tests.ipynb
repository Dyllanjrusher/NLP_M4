      "[\"Poor product and equally poor customer service. Purchased my MS170 with warranties from Stihl and Northern Tools. Reviewed the owners manual, filled it with Stihl fuel and filled the bar oil chamber. Took about ten pulls to start which was the first indication of a problem. Finally, it started but would immediately died after a load was placed on the unit. I assumed it was the new gremlins in the unit but then it completely died after less than 5 minutes of operation. Returned the unit to Northern Tools assuming they would fix the issue under warranty,but told me it was neglect on my part. This is not my first chainsaw or first time cutting trees since I've been doing this for 20 years, Totally lost fail in Northern Tools and Stihl since it feels like the warrant is just a gimmick and I sincerely feel they sold me a unit with a clutch that was seized or over torqued from the factor.... heck the hard start, dying under a load and seizing up. I recommend not getting the warranties and having Northern Tools run the unit for more than 5 minutes under load before you take the chainsaw home. A used Ferrari from a local used car sales man would last longer and the warranty would bear more integrity than Stihl and Northern Tools. \", \"Awesome saw for home use. This product is well designed and functions as described. Northern Tool sales staff took the time to full describe the product demonstrated how it works and did a full function test before leaving the store. They won't let you leave the store until these details are fulfilled. Mine was on sale for $160! You can't beat this deal! After leaving the store I went home and cut down an apple tree with no problems. The saw started without hesitation on each try. Why would you even look at another manufacturer when you can have the quality and support from Stihl? Especially at this price! \", \"Great little saw for what it is.. I have an older 029 Farm Boss but needed to cut 1500 Ironwood trees. I wanted a lighter saw as I was going to spend a lot of time bent over. This little saw did a great job. Most of the trees were 8-10 when they were large. All I was doing was dropping the tree and leaving them. I have used it on larger trees but only if I forgot the bring the 029. I beat the you know what out of this saw and it is still running strong. I don't think it was designed for what I did with it but it worked. I use premium gas and stihl oil and it starts every time. I would purchase it again. \", \"Underpowered, plastic, like a cheap copy. i bought this saw to replace a Poulan saw that was flat worn out. i have used Stihl saws for years and never been disappointed until now. this saw is cheaply built, underpowered and my first one blew up this first time i used it, and had to be replaced under warranty(and the store gave me a very hard time and blamed me). i find this saw goes through fuel very quickly and the chain is in constant need of adjustment after only a few cuts. it doesn't even have a real felling dog(just a plastic one for show cast into the case!), which makes it hard to get a bite on what it's cutting. \", \"Starting a problem. This chainsaw would work much better as a boat anchor than a chainsaw. It was fine for a year but year two it wouldn't start. The geniuses at stihl blamed it on a bad sparkplug and bad fuel (btw I only use premixed stihl fuel, motomix). They replaced the plug and fuel, it started once and now will not start again. Back to the dealership. Also, very cheaply made. Save about 100 and get a cheap chainsaw from a big box store. I'm sure it will start. \"]\n",
      "['Good overall value and for this size saw. I have owned two of the 455 rancher saws and have had good performance from them. Design of the power head is quite good for this size saw. Primer bulb and compression relief along with the choke design work well and make it reliable to start and idles well as long as you use the recommended 2 cycle oil (do not use inexpensive 2 cycle oil) and fresh non-ethanol gasoline. I also recommend using a higher quality bar oil rather than the cheapest ones out there as I had clumping and contamination in them and had to throw them out.. I did learn the hard way to not have the chain brake on while letting it idle. It overheated the clutch and warped the bar oil tank and it leaked from then on and ruined the clutch. Some other brands can idle with the brake on but not this one. This is not a defect but a part of the design. Just be aware of it.. The saw with the 20 inch bar is capable of handling medium size tree falling, limbing and bucking all day long with reasonable fuel and bar oil use depending on species of tree being worked on. I would not use a longer bar on this saw and i believe it is not recommended.. Cheap bar oils do not oil the bar and tip properly and I nearly burned up a bar before i caught it on the first saw. I do wish that it came equipped with what is known in the logging industry as a twin ring speed clutch instead of the star gear chain drive and a cloth type cleanable air filter as I operate in conditions which are hard on saws and other professionals have made these modifications to their saws.. I Bought a second one as the first one performed well and i am happy to report it is working as well as the first one. I have owned other brands of high end professional saws and worked with others in the logging industry and after several years of use I can recommend this saw. ', 'Newbie picks the Rancher 455. Based on various reviews, bar size, power, and the price, I chose the Rancher 455 with 20\" bar to help me process wood on my property and for an emergency should a tree fall and block my road. My nearby TSC had it in stock (!!), and I made my first cuts the day after I purchased it.. I have used only one other chainsaw (ever) briefly to cut a small branch, so this was a new experience. I was able to cut through 18\" of oak fairly well with the 455, although it did bog down a little as it got much of the way through the log and began to pinch. I attribute that mostly to my lack of experience and some to the saw, which is high-end consumer for power. But, yes, you do get through this heavy wood.. The saw looks heavy by the specs, but it\\'s actually easy to wield. It feels very balanced.. Despite my learning curve, I am confident when using it. Cautious and careful, but confident.. Starting the saw is a series of 4 steps and a pull, but once you memorize the steps, you knock through them quickly. Occasionally this saw will be a little stubborn for starting, but it\\'ll go. I think that\\'s typical of 2 cycle engines anyway.. The anti-vibration feature is KEY, folks. Must have!. Bottom line is this saw has helped me to process some heavy 18\" oak, so it\\'s got the beans. For a price that includes anti-vibration, I think this one\\'s a winner.. If you are new to this, you\\'ll want to look into other tools to help you manage the wood, such as a log splitter and something like a LogOx (peavey/cant, timberjack). A chainsaw isn\\'t enough unless you\\'re a total brute who wins the caber toss, which I\\'m not. Oak is heavy.. TSC has the Rancher 455 at a good price, and the additional warranty with Husqvarna when you buy some cans of fuel PLUS TSC\\'s extended warranty means this thing is covered for many years. ', \"Many years of dependable service. Many reviews are made when the product is new and shiny and the user is thrilled about their new toy. This review is a little different. When I was still in high school, I purchased my 455 Rancher used at a pawn shop. That was 15 years ago. I know nothing of how it was treated prior to me purchasing it. It looked like it had been pretty well used. I have used it to cut firewood to heat my parents house, my grandparents house, and most recently my first house. I have used it for numerous storm cleanup projects. When I was in college I would do yard work and trim trees on the weekends to help pay my bills. This was my only saw until a couple years ago when my wife bought me a 460 Rancher. I have logged literally hundreds of hours on this saw. I have completely worn two bars out. With the exception of normal maintenance, I have NEVER done any work on this saw. Normal maintenance was cleaning the air filter, replacing one spark plug, and replacing two bars and about a dozen chains. I let a buddy of mine borrow it for a couple of weeks to clear some brush at his dad's property. He was up in the air on what kind of saw to buy himself, after using mine for a couple weeks he went out and purchased one of his own.. In my opinion the power to weight ratio of this series of saw is a perfect balance. Not so heavy that it wears you out in a long day of cutting, yet powerful enough to go through the largest of limbs. Even hedge, which is mostly what we use to heat around here.. On a side note, my father purchased a Husqvarna 55 when I was about 2. It was his primary saw for years. When I was in high school he purchased another Husqvarna and I ran the 55 before I bought my 455. That saw is still running strong today. I am planning to inherit it someday.. I may be a little biased, but I will never own another brand of saw. I have run saws by other manufacturers and they never measure up. I have run some other husqvarnas, and I like them, however my old 455 is my favorite. \", 'Lighter, Meaner, More powerful,Chip slinging Beast. Where to start on this saw? It is very well built with a weight that falls below what I expected out of a 55cc class saw. The 20\" bar is a perfect working length for the motor. Startup was literally the second pull out of the box with most restarts once warm happening in one pull. This thing can throw the chips! Even when working through a hard heartwood it didn\\'t seem like it was breaking a sweat. When pushed really hard, it would bog down but keep pulling chain until the load lightened. It left some very impressive chip piles that built quickly while using the saw. This one replaced a 20+ year old competitive Mc-brand saw that was a war horse but easily weighed ten more pounds and had been rebuilt several times. Even with the work record of the old saw, this one has already shown it is more than capable of filling in for the old big saw and doing the same work at a faster pace. I had mulled over this purchase for a while and now that I own one, I wish I had bought it years ago. Plenty of power, responds quickly when the screaming stick is squeezed, and weighs less than expected for a saw of its capability. Buy one today and be ready to bench your old saw today. ', \"quirky and a waste of time - do not buy. While powerful, this chainsaw often has difficulty starting after running through gas. You have to put the chain break on if you want to take off the chain. If you fail to do that, then you will find it won't reassemble correctly. The provided chain is sometimes prone to coming off. The bolts that hold it together are prone to becoming loose due to high vibrations. That makes it hazardous to use. And this chainsaw leaks a lot of chain oil. I don't see other chainsaws leaking oil on the ground as much as this one. Overall, I would not recommend Husqvarna. Everything that can be wrong with a chainsaw is wrong in this model. For the price, you are better off with another brand such as Ego or Dewalt cordless electric or with Stihl for gas. Unless you are a pro, I would recommend cordless electric these days for most homeowners. This chainsaw just has too many special needs. I would rather be cutting wood then wasting my days figuring out how to get this Husqvarna chainsaw to work. Even when it is warmed up, this chainsaw often will not start. I strongly regret buying it. And it is overpriced given the number of drawbacks it has. \"]\n",
      "['The New Normal - Awesome Power!. I\\'ve been attracted to the new lithium technology in power tools and most recently investigated lithium chainsaws since my 4 year old Makita 2 stroke chainsaw is giving me a major headache and refuses to run reliably. I normally go out on public lands to collect about 2-3 cords of firewood per year. I had doubts about this saw\\'s cutting ability, specifically for getting firewood - way out there and away from power. Would I need a second expensive 5Ah battery? Here is what I just did with it yesterday, for anyone who is interested: I cut down four Douglas Firs, varying in width at the base from 10\" - 16\" in diameter, and 20 to 35 feet tall. To preserve the battery as much as possible, I made the cuts at 32\" instead of 16\" (I\\'ll slice them up more at home). Also, any time I wasn\\'t using the saw I plugged the battery pack in to the truck\\'s inverter, and was amazed to find that for the most part, after 20 mins or so the battery pack was back to a full charge. Overall, my impression is that this saw cuts through fairly large diameter logs like butter (I tried up to 18\"), and is very powerful. Being conscientious about topping the battery off while not in use allowed me to cut as much wood as I normally wood in a given outing.. Three tips to pay attention to to keep this saw in excellent shape:. 1) Keep the chain properly tensioned & oiled. 2) Drain the bar oil after use (I hear it can leak if not) - bring a funnel to make this less messy and easier. 3) Sharpen the chain after each use. That\\'s it....way less maintenance than a 2 stroke!. AWESOME AWESOME saw. So happy to step away from the 2 stroke chainsaws, those are going into the history books for me. So quiet, clean, and low maintenance. Here\\'s a pic of my collection in about 3.5 hours: ', 'EGO 14-inch Chainsaw with mismatched components that can\\'t be properly registered. I seem to have gotten an older saw that had been in stock for quite a while; the components have a Feb 19 date. It was the only one that Home Depot had with a battery and charger included (even though their website said there were four, because Home Depot is counting the chainsaw products without battery or charger). I have a CS1401, according to both the model number on the box, as well as the number on the Home Depot webpage.. When attempting to register the product, the EGO website lists two 14-inch saws with the same title (?!). The first model, CS1401 (which I have, according to the labeling on the box), should come with a BA1400T model number battery and expects a battery serial number starting with \"NBA08...\" This serial number prefix can\\'t be edited.) Unfortunately, my CS1401 shipped with a BA1400 model battery, so it fails to register the battery when you enter the remainder of the battery serial number. You can\\'t register it as the other model (CS1403), because that model expects yet another battery serial number prefix that doesn\\'t match the battery shipped with my saw.. So, I was only able to register the saw and the charger.... These types of logistical components mismatch simply shouldn\\'t occur, especially for an inexpensive product. I can\\'t even imagine how many failed registrations have occurred, and how many customers have given up on the registration process when the encounter the serial number prefix mismatches. But, maybe that\\'s the objective to discourage product registrations.. There are two many competing chainsaws to one that you can\\'t register in order to have warranty coverage--it\\'s best to choose a different brand. ', 'Threepeat!. This is the third Ego tool I have purchased. I bought the hedgetrimmer because I was tired of taking screens off of windows to get to an outlet and then running 250\\' of extension chords to the back of my property. I can do spring cleanup of hedges and last year\\'s perennials dieback in the time it used to take me to just get setup before. I then bought the string trimmer based on my huge success with the hedger. Once I got the hang of putting the line in the spool, it has been a dream. The battery makes the unit a bit heavier than my last weedwhacker - but it is a dream to run, easy to let out more string and it starts every time. I have never run out of battery life with the 2.5AH battery (despite having an acre lot with lots of edging). Then when it was time to replace my chainsaw, I read all the reviews and looked at my experience with their other products, and figured it was a no-brainer! I got the 16\" saw with the 5.0 AH battery and have used it twice. The first time was cleaning up everything I put off for 2 years deciding on a new saw. It ripped through everything I threw at it. I worked for a good hour and the battery kept chugging. I got a little careless with some branch cleanup and threw the chain - it only took about 5 minutes (because I am idiot with all things mechanical) to get it back on and fired it right back up and kept cuttin (it will likely take less time next time I screw up....because even idiots have a learning curve). It is a cinch to tighten the blade and have I mentioned yet that it starts every time! It sounds the same with the 2.5AH battery - but I haven\\'t tried cutting with it (tho my hunch is that the smaller battery would be fine for smaller, short jobs). Three champions in a row!!! I\\'m hooked. Couldn\\'t be more pleased! ', 'I\\'m happy with my EGO 14\" chainsaw. I was hesitant to purchase this after having used 2 cycle chain saws for years and being used to their power. But my last saw seized up and a recent nor\\'easter dropped a maple on our property. It was not full sized, but probably 12\" in diameter at the base. A red cedar was in its way and it took that tree with it. I was going to buy the 18\" EGO chainsaw but no store had one in my area, and not wanting to wait two weeks, I bought the 14\" saw. I already have an EGO trimmer and blower with batteries, so I opted for a new saw without battery. To say I was surprised with this saw\\'s capability is putting it mildly. It tore through the cedar (which is very tough wood) easily and even went through the 12\" maple without a problem. I used a 5 amp battery at first and the battery was still showing a green light when the saw ran out of chain oil. I started cutting the wood into fireplace size and probably had made about a quarter cord when I quit for the day, but the battery was still going strong. Today I continued to work at the trees using a 2.5 amp battery which also worked for a long time. The 5 amp battery was used for about 4 hours, and the 2.5 amp for about two hours but of course the saw isn\\'t running all the time. I recommend that you make sure you have chain oil in the unit all the time and use only a very sharp chain. The one they recommend in the manual has, I think, a lot to do with the success of the machine. Toward the end of the second day I ran into some vines and leaves, and the chain did come off the bar. That was the only time, and I had not been paying attention to the tightness of the chain. So, make sure it stays tight and you shouldn\\'t have a problem with it coming off as one reviewer that I read has reported. If you are a homeowner with trees this will cut through anything that you can handle alone, and it would be great for cutting firewood. It is not going to do the job easily if you are taking down very large trees, but what homeowner can do that alone anyway? Bottom line: perfect for the homeowner with trees on his lot. In retrospect I might have gone with the 18\" saw for the extra power, faster speed and automatic chain tightener but I\\'m happy with this one. ', \"I'm not much for writing reviews (this is maybe my second one ever), but I've been so impressed w.... I'm not much for writing reviews (this is maybe my second one ever), but I've been so impressed with this EGO chainsaw that it motivated me to do so. I've been using it regularly for 4 months now and have nothing but good things to say. It's well-built, well-engineered and performs flawlessly. And it's QUIET (always hated the noise of 2-cycle motors) and all you smell is fresh-cut wood. I have 4 hilly acres of woods that were originally planted as a Christmas tree farm years and years ago. All the pines are dying off so my woods are a tangled maze of dead, leaning, and vine-choked hulks. Clearing some paths is my retirement project. I soon found that when the saw got working through the vines, the thin ones would throw the chain. My solution was to get the EGO hedge trimmer (refurb without a battery for 70 bucks). I now get my fresh air and exercise by grabbing both tools, going after the vines first with the trimmer (it's a beast), swapping the battery over to the saw and then felling, limbing, and bucking. I run down before the battery. As long as the saw is sawing wood, I've never thrown the chain. Yesterday, I didn't bother switching back to the trimmer, and yup, threw the chain and in the process lost the retaining washer on the drive sprocket. Called EGO - they picked up almost immediately (on a Sunday) and within no time they had a replacement off to me. Customer service was amazing!. I can't recommend the saw (and the trimmer, and the company) highly enough. \"]\n",
      "['Lots of Power. Wish I\\'d bought this saw months ago. I have owned a 45cc saw with an 18\" bar for the last couple of years that I bought for general storm clean up and limbing. It\\'s been fine for that sort of work, but after we recently purchased a future retirement property with 12 acres of mixed hardwood and fir trees, it\\'s limitations became obvious. I managed to cut 4 full cords of firewood with it last Fall, and was going through chains and bars cutting through the larger trees. After researching, I decided on the 460 Rancher with a 24\" bar, as many of our dead fall trees are pretty large.. I just got the saw last week, and was able to cut down 4 large trees, and cut up three others into 4ft sections (to be cut and split later) in under an hour. The saw cut through the oak like it was butter. Starts and runs immediately, chain is easy to adjust/replace, and I look forward to getting the woodlot cleared up a lot faster than I previously thought possible. I would definitely recommend reading the owners manual to avoid frustration. My other saw is a Jonsered, (made by Husqvarna), so the operation is very similar. The saw is heavy duty in it\\'s construction and should last a long time. I will post another review in a few months after I have a chance to really use it. ', 'My new saw. I bought this saw last week as a replacement for a Husky 298 that I have had for almost 30 years. I\\'m 74 years old so I can\\'t use a saw with a long bar on it any more. This 460 Rancher came with a 24\" bar which is just right.. I love the features it came with like compression release and easy starting.. I was in Rural King in Zanesville just looking and got to talking with a Husqvarna rep and he is the one who convinced me to buy it. I am in the process of cutting down all the Ash trees on our farm that have died which maybe close to 100 when it all said an done. All they are good for is firewood so i\\'m giving them away as logs to friends and anyone who heats with wood. I have cut up almost 70 trees now and still have the bigger ones to cut because they aren\\'t leaning the right way. This saw makes it much easier them my smaller saws. My Husky 298 has a 30\" bar with no compression release, very heavy and is now needing parts which are no longer made. Tis 460 Rancher is the perfect replacement and great value for the money.

But, if you are using the saw all day, you will feel the weight before you are done. Still, this saw is no heavier than other saws of it's size and power. I bought this saws because my other saw will not run a bar/chain longer than 18 inches and I need to cut several trees that are larger than that. The saw runs great and cuts easily. It is easy to start despite it being 60cc. It has a decompression button for starting but still isn't hard to start even if you forget to use it.

I was taking down 2 40\\' tall and 46\" diameter red oak trees on my property. My Husqy 18\" saw was great for debranching but not enough to felling these monsters. I purchased the husqy 24\" 460 ranger on line and picked it up in the store week later. The unit came assembled in the box. Checked the bar and chain for tightness adjusted from the factory just right. Added gas and chain oil, 2 pulls on the starter cord and the unit started right up. I like that the oiler has 3 settings, used the # 3 setting and winter weight chain oil, 30 degrees that morning. Went to work and had the two trees felled within 4 hours. The 460 is considerably lighter than other more expensive brands but has the power and is a dream to handle. Two weeks later I have 6 cords of Red oak cut and seasoning for next year. I do quite a bit of tree cutting and I am glad I now have a Husqy 24\" in my tool shed. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a big guy for a job. ', 'Durable, versatile chainsaw. I\\'ve had my 460 Rancher for a little over 2 years, and it has been a great saw. I have 3 acres that had not been well-kept before we moved in, so there is a ton of brush to clear. I\\'ve been happy how this saw performs while clearing brush, bucking firewood, and even taking down a large pine. When I first got it I thought it might be a bit too much saw for me, but I\\'ve gotten comfortable with it, and I\\'m glad I have the extra power to comfortably run a 20\" bar.. On the maintenance front, I did find that it had a bar oil leak from the rubber piece where it joins the oil reservoir. It took an afternoon to tear down the saw and fix the leak with a little crazy glue, but since then it has been fine. This past winter the saw also got caught in a flooded basement, but after a couple days of drying out and a new sparkplug, it was back up and running! Its durability has been impressive. Less']\n",
      "['This is an honest working review of the 20V Dewalt pole saw. First off, agents my better judgemen.... This is an honest working review of the 20V Dewalt pole saw. First off, agents my better judgement from past experiences with this manufacture, I purchased the tool and a battery kit to prune small branches in an avao tree. I will say as far as the power and overall performance of this tool goes, it is comparable to other similar poll saws within +/- $100 of total cost. Where the criticism lies is in the design and tolerances, not that tolerance is of major concern here except for the joinery of the pole segments and I\\'ll touch on that in a moment. First off, the drive motor is integrated into the head-unit and not the handle, making it cumbersome as the majority of weight is distributed out at to the working-end of the pole. Balance is poor at best without the use of the extension. With the extension, that gives it approximately 10\\' of reach, it becomes even more unstable as the pole has quite a bit of \"flex\" and the connecting joints only magnify this symptom. You would think that when designing this tool with the decision to place the motor drive at the end of the pole, needing only a electrical cord running through the pole, that it should have been designed as telescoping instead of having a connecting segment with two weak points to extend reach...this would have been much more desirable. And as for these connecting joints, the \"weak link\" ....they are PVC with a \"hand screw\" outer coupling that does not \"compress\" the joint as it is tightened, leaving quite a bit of \"wobble\" right at the PVC joint. This is an extremely poor, loose joint....a deplorable design and coupled with the end-weight of the tool, there is just no way this joint can hold up for long...as if it were a \"built-in\" failing point that we see engineered so often in outsourced production. IMO, the quality of this tool more aligns with the Ryobe that is less than half the cost in a 40V and the Ryobe includes the battery. Better yet is the EGO, if you are spending the $300 required for this here Dewalt ensemble, get the EGO that has the drive built into the handle with the option of head attachments although keep in mind, EGO batteries are pricey but a better investment. ', 'Battery Powered Beast, Quality Parts. I have an old maple that has some dead limbs and some dying limbs. It was an old tree that was \"knuckled\" at one point in the past (don\\'t knuckle your trees!) so it is slowly dying and rotting from the inside. For a battery powered pole saw, this thing was a BEAST! 3 inch limbs were like butter. Extra \"grab\" hook to pull out cuttings from high above was a nice touch. Super sharp high quality chain. I did some work last summer with a plug in model (different brand) and that thing barely made it through 3-4 inch limbs.. Like I said, some of the limbs I was cutting with this pole saw were up to 10 inches wide and rotting hollow inside so lots of saw dust and pulp made it into the chain/blade housing. When I went to clean it after 2 days use and saw how much was jammed in there without any noticeable difference in performance, I was truly amazed. I used the 60V Flex battery with it and it was a champ.. A couple of points that were not problems but just for expectation, there is some bend in the pole when fully extended, could have been more stiff in construction there, but not a problem or issue. It just was a bit unsteady trying to get back into the same cut line when tackling larger limbs. I saw the review that complained it leaks oil. Yes, all of these types of pole saws are drip flow chain oil, the manual states to drain after each use. I actually did work on some trees for two days, and I had just propped the head up on an old chair with a towel underneath between days and it was fine. Some drip but didn\\'t drain out completely. With the blade head down, it would have dripped out completely. It\\'s drip fed, that\\'s how it works. Cleaned it out fully after the second day. Easy to break down and clean, easy to reassemble. ', \"Good. Could have been even better. I considered the dewalt pole saw over the Milwaukee given I already have dewalt tools this was a very tough choice to make.. It cuts great surprisingly for a 20v. Just rest the saw on a branch and it works. It's not fast and not slow either (I cut pine tree branches with it.) It's long and awkward if you use the included extension pole.. Dewalt decided to have the motor on the tool itself. All the pole does is provide a power supply to the saw attachment so as you guys might guess the pole is heavy at the end making it pretty awkward so use extreme caution when cutting at maximum reach and especially when you're cutting off a ladder the tool will want to come crashing down after cutting large branches. Make sure you get chainsaw oil for this saw you will need it. This tool looks like it can become useless if you dont store it right. This power tool attaches to one another via plastic threads which you twist together. If the threads get damaged or the caps your pole WILL BECOME USELESS.. Now I would have preferred Milwaukee's equivalent as the motor is on the pole itself so the weight isn't on the ends. Also The milwaukee saw is 10in vs dewalts 8in . It uses a quick attachment/detachment mechanism. BUT if I had the money to invest in the complete setup I would have chosen the Milwaukee. Also dewalt also seems to have powertool attachment options like Milwaukee. You can use a hedge trimmer but good luck finding it anywhere as there sold out. I'm sure dewalt also offers a weed whacker attachment as well \", 'Great battery powered pole saw!. While this definitely doesn’t have the power of a gas pole saw, it does exceptionally well for being battery powered. As others have said it is a bit top heavy, and it can get a bit unwieldy when it is extended out to its full length. Let me explain. I was using it to cut branches beyond the maximum 15’ cut height, some of which were directly overhead or were out a ways, and when resting the head of the saw on the branch it cut through them with ease, but presented me with a new problem. Once the branch was cut the saw would fall to the ground right alongside the branch, and while I was able to catch it in time before hitting the ground, it put unnecessary strain on the shaft. After this happened I had a brilliant(for me) idea. I bought 100’ of 1/4” rope, tied a noose on one end, and then tossed the noose over a branch higher than the one I’m cutting. Then I put the noose around the head of the saw, just above the knuckle that mounts the saw to the shaft. I grab the rope in one hand, the handle in the other and I’m ready to cut branches as far as I can reach. Pulling on the rope with one hand virtually eliminates the weight of the saw, and while cutting the branch helps counter balance the saw and once the branch is cut, the saw sits up there waiting for its next job. I hope this helps someone else as much as it helped me. ', \"Was very simple to put together - quite pleased with the wide threads used to link the parts. I .... Was very simple to put together - quite pleased with the wide threads used to link the parts. I used a (AH Battery - which I believe balanced the Pole when fully extended. I have a chain saw - this Pole saw cut twice as fast and twice as easy as my chain saw. I was on a Ladder 25 feet up to cut a branch that was 35 feet off the ground. Just placed the saw on the branch and then started the chain saw - it went through that 8 inch branch like butter - I did not have to exert any downward pressure on the Pole Saw - quite impressed.. When this large branch was on the ground - I took off one of the extensions to the Pole SAW and used the Pole Saw to cut up the branch into smaller logs I can transport easily.. I have only used it once - it was purchased just to remove this large branch - that was above my Wife's raspberry patch - the branch made her nervous working under it. I plan to use it to remove many other dead branches on many other trees in our lower back yard - that are all over 25 feet off the ground - thus I just need a short ladder to remove them safely. \"]\n",

      "['Lots of Power. Wish I\\'d bought this saw months ago. I have owned a 45cc saw with an 18\" bar for the last couple of years that I bought for general storm clean up and limbing. It\\'s been fine for that sort of work, but after we recently purchased a future retirement property with 12 acres of mixed hardwood and fir trees, it\\'s limitations became obvious.

      "['Lots of Power. Wish I\\'d bought this saw months ago. I have owned a 45cc saw with an 18\" bar for the last couple of years that I bought for general storm clean up and limbing. It\\'s been fine for that sort of work, but after we recently purchased a future retirement property with 12 acres of mixed hardwood and fir trees, it\\'s limitations became obvious. I managed to cut 4 full cords of firewood with it last Fall, and was going through chains and bars cutting through the larger trees. After researching, I decided on the 460 Rancher with a 24\" bar, as many of our dead fall trees are pretty large.. I just got the saw last week, and was able to cut down 4 large trees, and cut up three others into 4ft sections (to be cut and split later) in under an hour. The saw cut through the oak like it was butter. Starts and runs immediately, chain is easy to adjust/replace, and I look forward to getting the woodlot cleared up a lot faster than I previously thought possible. I would definitely recommend reading the owners manual to avoid frustration. My other saw is a Jonsered, (made by Husqvarna), so the operation is very similar. The saw is heavy duty in it\\'s construction and should last a long time. I will post another review in a few months after I have a chance to really use it. ', 'My new saw. I bought this saw last week as a replacement for a Husky 298 that I have had for almost 30 years. I\\'m 74 years old so I can\\'t use a saw with a long bar on it any more. This 460 Rancher came with a 24\" bar which is just right.. I love the features it came with like compression release and easy starting.. I was in Rural King in Zanesville just looking and got to talking with a Husqvarna rep and he is the one who convinced me to buy it. I am in the process of cutting down all the Ash trees on our farm that have died which maybe close to 100 when it all said an done. All they are good for is firewood so i\\'m giving them away as logs to friends and anyone who heats with wood. I have cut up almost 70 trees now and still have the bigger ones to cut because they aren\\'t leaning the right way. This saw makes it much easier them my smaller saws. My Husky 298 has a 30\" bar with no compression release, very heavy and is now needing parts which are no longer made. Tis 460 Rancher is the perfect replacement and great value for the money. ', \"Great saw, if you need it.. The Husqvarna 460 is an excellent saw. It has a lot of power but power comes at a price. Before you buy the 460, be honest with yourself and decide if this is the saw you REALLY need. THIS SAW IS HEAVY. The 24 in. bar balances the saw very well and makes the saw seem not so heavy. But, if you are using the saw all day, you will feel the weight before you are done. Still, this saw is no heavier than other saws of it's size and power. I bought this saws because my other saw will not run a bar/chain longer than 18 inches and I need to cut several trees that are larger than that. The saw runs great and cuts easily. It is easy to start despite it being 60cc. It has a decompression button for starting but still isn't hard to start even if you forget to use it. When you unpack this saw you will need to change the chain oiler setting . READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. The saw comes set in position 2 for the oiler and needs to be set to position 3 for the 24 in. bar. This is an excellent saw and will easily do the job, just make sure you are not buying a bigger saw than you really need. \", 'Great Bang for the Buxk. I was taking down 2 40\\' tall and 46\" diameter red oak trees on my property. My Husqy 18\" saw was great for debranching but not enough to felling these monsters. I purchased the husqy 24\" 460 ranger on line and picked it up in the store week later. The unit came assembled in the box. Checked the bar and chain for tightness adjusted from the factory just right. Added gas and chain oil, 2 pulls on the starter cord and the unit started right up. I like that the oiler has 3 settings, used the # 3 setting and winter weight chain oil, 30 degrees that morning. Went to work and had the two trees felled within 4 hours. The 460 is considerably lighter than other more expensive brands but has the power and is a dream to handle. Two weeks later I have 6 cords of Red oak cut and seasoning for next year. I do quite a bit of tree cutting and I am glad I now have a Husqy 24\" in my tool shed. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a big guy for a job. ', 'Durable, versatile chainsaw.

      "[\"Great chainsaw and easy to use. Never used an electric chainsaw before but looked over the reviews and some articles to decide and glad I did. I don't have as much property as before so it's easier to get an extension cord almost everywhere. Had a huge tree cut down in my front yard but they didn't cut it into small enough logs for me to move so I was hoping for a chainsaw that would without having to be gas. This chainsaw worked amazingly. It's easy to get to the bar and chain and easy to adjust or tighten. I cut some logs that were over 2 feet in diameter and smaller ones were a breeze. Didn't realize it didn't come with bar and chain oil but glad I read over the entire manual and found that, but it seems to use up a full reservoir in 3 hours of cutting. All in all this chainsaw is great and I love it! Look at the photos for some reference of what I cut up. Less\", \"Still needs some improvement. If you are battling with eucalyptus trees, this saw will get the job done, but barely. There are three significant issues.. 1) The chain tensioning mechanism is not quite as automatic as it is supposed to be. This means that the chain will lose tension in operation, especially if you are working on 2ft diameter eucalyptus trunks, and if you don't stop and manually check the tension frequently, the saw will throw the chain and damage the plastic (!!!!!) shroud over the chain and sprocket.. 2) It is impossible to advance the chain manually along the bar when sharpening the chain. This is probably a safety feature, but it makes sharpening the chain a tedious chore. Sharpen a few teeth, take the shroud off, free the chain from the sprocket and advance to the next set of teeth, put the shroud back on and retension the chain to ensure you get the correct angle as you sharpen the next few teeth, then repeat until done. Some kind of clutch mechanism that allows the sprocket to rotate when the motor is off would fix this issue.. 3) Stores do not stock the replacement chain. They are readily available on-line, but when you are in the middle of a job on a weekend and you realize you have sharpened the chain as far as is safe, you can't just run to your local Big Box store and grab a new chain. The solution here is to keep a spare at all times, and as soon as you have to put a new chain to use, go order its replacement. \", 'phenomenol product. I recently purchased a 16\" corded electric chain saw after my neighbor recommended the Worx model 303.1. This tool exceeded my expectations. My son, a professional landscaper said the saw is superior to more expensive gasoline saws he uses in his business. Operation is smooth easy and performance outstanding. We\\'ve been cutting large mesquite trees, up to 10 inch diameter, with ease. In fact my wife has to keep an eye on me so I don\\'t cut down all of her trees the saw is so enjoyable to use.

Plug it in. Push the .... Easy to understand and use. Fill the reservoir with chain lube to the mark. Plug it in. Push the chain brake handle and start cutting.. The auto tension feature on the chain bar is the key selling point- on my old gas powered chainsaw, I had to constantly stop to adjust. The chain is always tight to the bar which helps reduce pinching if you make a wrong angle cut.. The blades were sharp and I cut through logs bigger than my thighs like a hot knife through butter. I was honestly amazed at the power and torque. Never thought an electric saw could handle it. It would have done fine with logs twice that size.. Felt safe and secure the whole time- did not get much push back.. It was too heavy for me to use just one arm to hold it as I was trying to reach a higher branch,,,, but I guess that's not too safe anyway.. 3 year warranty and low price= Winner for light duty tree cutting and trimming. \"]\n",
      "[\"For the homeowner that needs a chainsaw a couple of times a year, this saw would be hard to beat..... For the homeowner that needs a chainsaw a couple of times a year, this saw would be hard to beat. It is the easiest starting (hot or cold) 2-cycle engine that I have ever used. I only use the ethanol-free pre-mixed 40:1 gas. The Home Depot house brand works very well. Impressed with how little it vibrates and how the balance of it makes cutting easy and enjoyable. Make sure that you keep a sharp chain on it--from experience, only buy Oregon chains--they really last and seem to hold their edge better. A few weeks ago, I really hammered this saw when a huge pine tree came down in a storm. Parts of the trunk were over 30 inches in diameter. The kept going after hours and hours of cutting. Cutting the huge stump close to the ground was a real challenge that the Remington accepted and did well. Chain oiler works well when cutting and has an adjustable flow rate. Only thing I don't like is that the saw drips bar oil like crazy when not using it. At least the oil drips are confined to the bottom of the rugged plastic case. if you drain the bar oil before putting it away, the oil mess is a lot smaller. Without question, this saw is a great value and seems to be of very good quality. I have been using the saw for over a year now and would buy another one in a heartbeat if I need one. \", \"Quality chainsaw for the price point. My Stihl chainsaw had about seen it's last days and this c.... Quality chainsaw for the price point. My Stihl chainsaw had about seen it's last days and this chainsaw became available to own, so I decided to give it a try. After unboxing the saw and taking it out of a well made and heavy duty plastic carrying case, the first glimpse that it was going to be a quality saw was that the chain and bar were Oregon brand which are the top-of-the-line quality. The saw has ant-vibration built throughout and is well balanced when holding it. The recoil starter is spring assisted which will take some getting used to. Another feature that hints at quality is the chain oil flow to the bar is adjustable via an easily accessible adjusting screw on the bottom of the unit. Cheaper made and lower quality chainsaws do not have this feature. The Oregon bar has a quality greasable roller tip that will make the saw's chain cut easier. Unfortunately the saw does not come with a needle greaser and it is imperative that the nose is kept lubricated. I would suggest buying a good quality greaser and Home Depot has a nice one at https://www.homedepot.com/p/Blue-Max-Chainsaw-Grease-Gun-Tool-21134/303412777?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-202519480-_-303412777-_-N . The saw has plenty of power for cuts up to 16 inch diameter. The saw does come with a tool kit and enough synthetic 2-cycle oil to mix 1 gallon of fuel. It should be noted that most of the regular fuel today has 10% ethanol (alcohol) added which starts to absorb water once you pump it and is only recommended to be used for 30 days, unless it has fuel stabilizer added to it. One way around this is to use a premium fuel that does not have ethanol added and using synthetic 2 cycle oil. For the occasional user that doesn't want to mix their gas and oil, the market has fuel in a can that has premium everything already mixed and you just have to fill the fuel tank. Home Depot also has this available https://www.homedepot.com/p/TruSouth-Trufuel-50-1-Pre-mixed-Fuel-Oil-6525638/202532877 or https://www.homedepot.com/p/TruSouth-TruFuel-50-1-Pre-Oil-Mix-6525606/205913129. I know that Remington says to use a 40:1 mix ration and the fuel-in-a-can is 50:1, but unless you are going to be running the saw under heavy load all the time, the premium 50:1 in a can will be fine ( read http://community.homedepot.com/howto/DiscussionDetail/501-vs-401-Fuel-Mix-906500000008bMB ), and 40:1 fuel-in-a-can is still available on the market.. The include Operator's Manual is excellent covering everything about the saw AND how to cut logs and use for pruning. \", \"Good Homeowner Chain Saw Two years ago a winter storm felled four 30+ year old pine trees in my i.... Good Homeowner Chain Saw. Two years ago a winter storm felled four 30+ year old pine trees in my immediate neighborhood, two of which wound up in my back yard and had to have someone come to remove them. I don’t need a chainsaw often, but when I do, I really do. I have a small electric chainsaw that is good for light duty cutting, but as the trees around my house get bigger, that saw no longer was up to the task. I also needed the portability that a gas saw provides. Then I found the Remington Outlaw. This 20 in gas powered saw is a beast compared to what I have and is more than capable of taking on these tasks and has a good price point. The saw being 20 in IS long, but I also plan to cut tree ‘slabs’ for some woodworking projects I have planned, so it is a bit of future proofing on my part.. The saw comes with a blow molded case and scabbard and I am glad it does; I like having its own storage. There is also a spot for a small bottle of 2 cycle oil in the case (which, by the way, Remington provides with the saw out of the box) and something they call a multitool, which is a screwdriver, wrench, and spark plug remover all in one (and it has its own space in the case as well). You do need to buy some bar oil before you use it. The scabbard disconnects from the case, so you can keep the chain protected as you carry it.. Remington provides one of the biggest, most detailed instruction manuals I have ever seen, with a LOT of it devoted to safety and how to use the saw. After some of the tool manuals I have recently gone through, this is nice. I don’t think there was anything that wasn’t covered in it. It even tells you how to sharpen the chain, if you decide you want to do that on your own. I do recommend reading it before using the saw.. Tensioning the chain is easy; all you need is a flat head screwdriver (or the provided multitool). Since the multitool is a little big, I just carry a separate flat head screwdriver for on the fly adjustments while using the saw (tension will change as the saw goes from cold to hot). Saw started up pretty quickly the first time; I did not have to adjust the idle, but the instructions are pretty detailed, so if you do it should not be a big deal. It ran just fine and cut great: exactly what I needed. It felt good in my hands, and the vibration was not excessive (I had no arm or hand fatigue), but I only cut for 10-15 minutes at a time.. Saw is about the same weight/heft as other saws this size. The case however is big and almost as heavy as the saw, so the two together are pretty weighty. I am glad to have the case though, since I like the idea of having separate storage for it, and since all saws seem to leak some bar oil, it’s nice to have it contained (this saw has not leaked much yet).. There is a lot of hard plastic on this saw; it seems to be typical of saws in this category. I might be more concerned if I was using this saw on a constant and regular/daily basis, but for what I use it for, it will be fine.. Two real complaints: One is the choke; it just doesn’t feel right, kind of like you could break it easily. It is some sort of plastic and you have to really pull it out to get it to stay while you prep the engine. Thankfully that’s the only fiddling you have to do with it. The other is the chain brake: it works fine but felt a little stiff in its movement (this could be normal for saws but I just don't know for sure). It is also hard plastic and feels a little more flimsy than I would like, but for a homeowner and DIY’er like myself I expect it to be fine.. Bottom line: if you are homeowner and need a chainsaw for your annual or semiannual tree work, I recommend this saw. It is one of the biggest saws (chain and bar wise) in this category and should be good for pretty much all the tasks you need. It has a good build and price, and should last for many seasons. \", 'Lot of great reviews - wasn\\'t my experience.. After reading all of the great reviews, I bought one of these saws last year. Huge Mistake. Piece of crap. Barely cuts through any tree larger than a twig, even after changing chains three times. leaks an extraordinary amount of bar oil. Separately, the bar oil cap won\\'t tighten, as though it\\'s rounded out. Heavy and cumbersome to use. I have no idea why there have been so many positive reviews, because that just has not been my experience. I have barely used this thing because it just isn\\'t worth the frustration.

This Remington \"Outlaw\" chainsaw may not be the most powerful chainsaw I have used in my career, but it is the cleanest burning. The 20\" bar does the job driven by the 46cc power plant. I know the new chain is a big part of the power this saw has shown. I have had no issues with this saw after getting through its first cord of wood. The 46cc engine is just as loud as any other 2 cycle powered saw I have used. This is a powerful enough chain saw to get through 33 inch diameter wood. And before you ask a 20 inch chain bar does not cut through 33 in material without moving the saw around the wood while cutting it. The saw never lugged down as it cut the cord of wood. The chips from this saw flew over the entire area just as any chain saw does. You still need your googles and ear protection as with any wood cutting saw. The Remington RM4620 does a good job cutting through either your cleanup or wood yard preparation for winter. You will see the wood piles cutting down as fast as you can put this saw through the stacks of wood. ']\n",
      "['Great saw for the average homeowner.. So far so good. I\\'ve only had it for 2 days but I\\'m loving the quality of the saw.. I had someone cut down a tree and told them I\\'d cut up what they brought down to save myself a lot of money versus having them do it. I\\'m not sure what type of tree it is, someone told me oak but another told me maple.. The setup was easy. I only had to tighten the chain some. I followed the instructions on initial startup and it started right up.. I made sure to adjust the chain tension after running it for 15 minutes because I read they stretch when new. I had to do this probably 3 or 4 times until it seemed the chain tensioner was no longer needing adjustment.. The guys were using $700 Stihl saws and there was definitely a difference in power but not so much that I\\'d spend the extra $400 for one. If I did it for a living I might consider it but like I said, this saw wasn\\'t too far behind theirs. They even said they\\'ll get one as a backup or for smaller jobs.. I\\'ve included pictures showing what I cut with this saw. I kind of wish I\\'d sprang for the 20\" bar since some of the logs were beyond the rated capabilities of the CS-400. But, I made it work.

I made about 5-6 full width cuts and the saw just went through the tree effortlessly. The 7th cut was another story, it was hardly getting into the tree. I examined the chain and saw that all the left sided teeth were gone! Don\\'t know how, I did not hit any stones or nails and the saw was full or bar and chain oil? The next day I got lucky and found a couple Oregon chains on clearance sale. I installed one of the new Oregon chains and went back to work. Bingo, cutting like butter again! I have gotten through 2 of the 3 trees so far on the new chain. The only thing I need to do is sharpen the chain every so often.. It has been over 1 week now and The ECHO CS-400 is a work horse!!! It is a quality chainsaw (except for the chain that comes with it). It starts every time and cuts through everything I have put in it\\'s path.

I have had zero problems with it or my other ECHOs. Someone recommended putting an Oregon chain on it, I did. I'm going to put the OEM chain back on when the replacement wears out. I also have an ECHO string trimmer (GT 225) and leaf blower (PB250LN). Echo makes some fine engines. They all start easily. I'm sold on value and quality.

I used to have a smaller 14 inch chainsaw, but when left in the garage, the engine and exposed parts constantly collected grime and dirt.. This one however comes with a great carrying case and storage box.. From the onset, having a larger chainsaw (18 inches), this weighs a lot more than I expected. This is all metal. No cheap plastic here. You have to have some harm strength if you are going to use this for an extended period of yardwork.. For me, that was my primary purpose - yardwork. I do all of our trees and our neighbor's trees at least once a year. Some of it requires trimming branches that grow above and beyond what a branch cutter could clear. I know having an 18 inch chainsaw is overkill for my purpose, but it does the trick.. Know that it is also slightly too large to crown a palm tree with. It is just too heavy and big for that.. Another purpose I have used it for this summer is cutting down large trunks I can buy for smoking meats. Sometimes you can get a really good deal on buying an uncut piece of wood (apple, oak, etc) and then chopping/breaking it down with a chainsaw. It sure is a lot easier than chopping wood with an axe!.

With the engine and bar, it is an overall nice size. Just referencing the bar itself, very easy to manage or most people. (and allows you to get into some tight places ) You would be surprised the size tree you can cut down with a 14\" saw (if you do it correctly and safely). IF you REALLY NEED to go larger, you can just buy a larger bar and chain. This engine seems to have the power to support (at least up to 18\").. THIS particular saw has all the desirable features as well. Manual choke, primer, automatic (and adjustable) bar oiler.. Additionally, IF you are a novice at using a chainsaw the manual provides a lot of easy to understand guidance and diagrams for safe \"felling\" and \"trimming\" scenarios.....

This is not my first chainsaw or first time cutting trees since I've been doing this for 20 years, Totally lost fail in Northern Tools and Stihl since it feels like the warrant is just a gimmick and I sincerely feel they sold me a unit with a clutch that was seized or over torqued from the factor.... heck the hard start, dying under a load and seizing up. I recommend not getting the warranties and having Northern Tools run the unit for more than 5 minutes under load before you take the chainsaw home.

After leaving the store I went home and cut down an apple tree with no problems. The saw started without hesitation on each try. Why would you even look at another manufacturer when you can have the quality and support from Stihl? Especially at this price! \", \"Great little saw for what it is.. I have an older 029 Farm Boss but needed to cut 1500 Ironwood trees. I wanted a lighter saw as I was going to spend a lot of time bent over. This little saw did a great job. Most of the trees were 8-10 when they were large. All I was doing was dropping the tree and leaving them. I have used it on larger trees but only if I forgot the bring the 029. I beat the you know what out of this saw and it is still running strong. I don't think it was designed for what I did with it but it worked. I use premium gas and stihl oil and it starts every time. I would purchase it again. \", \"Underpowered, plastic, like a cheap copy. i bought this saw to replace a Poulan saw that was flat worn out. i have used Stihl saws for years and never been disappointed until now. this saw is cheaply built, underpowered and my first one blew up this first time i used it, and had to be replaced under warranty(and the store gave me a very hard time and blamed me). i find this saw goes through fuel very quickly and the chain is in constant need of adjustment after only a few cuts. it doesn't even have a real felling dog(just a plastic one for show cast into the case!), which makes it hard to get a bite on what it's cutting. \", \"Starting a problem. This chainsaw would work much better as a boat anchor than a chainsaw. It was fine for a year but year two it wouldn't start. The geniuses at stihl blamed it on a bad sparkplug and bad fuel (btw I only use premixed stihl fuel, motomix). They replaced the plug and fuel, it started once and now will not start again. Back to the dealership. Also, very cheaply made. Save about 100 and get a cheap chainsaw from a big box store. I'm sure it will start. \"]\n",
      "['Great saw for the average homeowner.. So far so good. I\\'ve only had it for 2 days but I\\'m loving the quality of the saw.. I had someone cut down a tree and told them I\\'d cut up what they brought down to save myself a lot of money versus having them do it. I\\'m not sure what type of tree it is, someone told me oak but another told me maple.. The setup was easy. I only had to tighten the chain some. I followed the instructions on initial startup and it started right up.. I made sure to adjust the chain tension after running it for 15 minutes because I read they stretch when new. I had to do this probably 3 or 4 times until it seemed the chain tensioner was no longer needing adjustment.. The guys were using $700 Stihl saws and there was definitely a difference in power but not so much that I\\'d spend the extra $400 for one. If I did it for a living I might consider it but like I said, this saw wasn\\'t too far behind theirs. They even said they\\'ll get one as a backup or for smaller jobs.. I\\'ve included pictures showing what I cut with this saw. I kind of wish I\\'d sprang for the 20\" bar since some of the logs were beyond the rated capabilities of the CS-400. But, I made it work.

I had a storm take down 3 large maple trees (18\"-24\" dia.) in my yard and needed a good chainsaw. I first bought a different brand (18\" @ 42CC) from another retailer. This one lasted one day, it struggled on every cut and just about burned itself out, so I took it back. Went to Home Depot and bought the ECHO CS-400 (18\" @ 40.2CC). Talk about night and day! I made about 5-6 full width cuts and the saw just went through the tree effortlessly. The 7th cut was another story, it was hardly getting into the tree. I examined the chain and saw that all the left sided teeth were gone! Don\\'t know how, I did not hit any stones or nails and the saw was full or bar and chain oil? The next day I got lucky and found a couple Oregon chains on clearance sale. I installed one of the new Oregon ... More', 'Let me save you time and money. I am an average home owner that I like to do and repair things on my own. This was my first time purchasing a Chainsaw not my first time using one and decided to go with Ryobi because of the price and compare with the other expensive brands the Ryobi show better features but dont let the features or accessories trick you. I spend two days with the ryobi chainsaw pulling the cord, fighting to turning on and I follow every step on the guide, plus watch many videos in youtube how to use it, the first day I can only used it for one hour by next day the chain was already loose and need it an adjustment around 5pm on day number two I was frustrate, tired and sore for spending all day trying to turn the chain saw. I decided to go back to Home Depot returned and purchase an ECHO Chainsaw for my surprise the machine turn on with no effort and the engine stay on the whole time in just one hour was able to cut all the wood that I tried to cut in two days with the Ryobi. The quality of the Echo compare with the Ryobi piece of crap was so noticeable that my wife came out of that house because the sound of the motor on the Echo sound like a sport car compare with the motor of the Ryobi that sound more like a Hyundai going up hill. if this is your first time purchasing a chainsaw this is it, value your time the Echo chainsaw cut wood like butter and the quality of the parts are durable. ', 'This chainsaw rocks!. After my Poulan Pro died (could never keep it running), I bought a 40V electric chainsaw. That was a big mistake. It could not handle anything but small limbs and it struggled doing that as well as battery life. I decided on a bigger better gas chainsaw. I went out to purchase a Husqvarna at Home Depot and were sold out of the one I wanted. they did have the equivalent size in the Echo CS400 18\" for less money. I was hesitant to buy it as I was not familiar with the Echo line. I did end up buying it and I am extremely pleased. I had 5 oak trees to deal with at home and this thing ate through them with out even a hiccup. Started right up from the start and started first shot even when hot. I used premixed ethanol free 50:1 and don\\'t forget bar and chain oil. Chain was perfect tension out of the box. Not too heavy and built well. I can do nothing but praise this beast! Well done ECHO! ', \"Starts everytime. It usually starts second pull. Occasionally, third pull. It definitely does its job. I have cut down four trees so far and it outperforms my other two chain saws. I was initially skeptical, (reading the negative reviews) but I concluded the hard starting problems were probably those who do not use 50:1 gas or do not put a gas stabilizer in the fuel. I have had zero problems with it or my other ECHOs. Someone recommended putting an Oregon chain on it, I did. I'm going to put the OEM chain back on when the replacement wears out. I also have an ECHO string trimmer (GT 225) and leaf blower (PB250LN). Echo makes some fine engines. They all start easily. I'm sold on value and quality. I would and do recommend Echo products to anyone interested. If they made a car, I would probably buy one. Less\"]\n",
      "['Tinkering Required. I was a little nervous about buying this saw based on several reviews regarding the oiler leaking (chronic problem with my old saw) and condition. When I opened the box, my fears were realized, the bag and box were soaked in bar oil. After wiping all the oil off I could tell the saw was used but not abused, few scratches here and there. Next, on to the leaking oil. After taking off the outside chain cover and clutch I was able to remove the metal shield covering the oiler pump and plastic housing.. My first observation after this cover was removed was that the rubber block that interfaces with the oil reservoir port (and also houses the oiler pump shaft) was crooked. This block is taller than the space under the metal shield and when the shield is clamped in place with the chain bar it compresses this rubber block sealing it against the oil port. I cleaned up and re-greased the oil pump drive mechanism and reinstalled the rubber block being careful to make sure it was square to the shield. I installed my bar and chain and filled with husky oil. I pulled it 20-30 times to get oil up to the bar and let it sit overnight....no more leak!. After filling it with Husky fuel and following the very clear starting instructions it fired up on like the 4th pull. I made some cuts on a 9\" and 15\" dia log and it quickly went through them at a reasonable rate without issue. No leaks after cutting either. Looking forward to using it on some standing timber I need to take down in the future.. ', 'Don’t be scared of grade B', 'Ran for about half hour and then died. Fresh gas mixed with the Husqvarna 2-stoke oil according to instructions (mindful of the ethanol content). Husqvarna branded bar and chain oil. I have owned and used many Husqvarna (and other brand) saws in the past 45 years (purchased used) and really was looking forward to my first ever brand new saw. Saw was initially a little hard to start, but it\\'s new and cold, so I thought \"no big deal\". Once saw was started, it seemed to lack power and would get bogged down rather quickly when trying to block out firewood - granted it was an old oak tree and as large as the guide almost, but my old 359 would slide right through that stuff and more. About 1/2 hour into cutting, the saw just died. It was throwing good chips and I was taking care to not bog it out and keep the chain speed up - but, it just quit in mid cut. I tried to restart it and it would sputter some then immediately die. Checked the fuel and it was low, but not out. Let the saw cool off for about 10 minutes and filled both gas and bar oil back up. Again, attempted to start the saw. Sputter and die was all it would do. Tried to start it for about 1/2 hour (yes, I wore out and the son-in-law gave it a go until he was done and we swapped back...) Start, run 3-4 seconds, sputter and die... Went back up to myshop, grabbed my old, little Husqvarna saw to finish topping out the limbs and give the new, big one time to completely cool off. And again, no go... Same behavior... I did check the compression relief and it was performing as it should. We pulled the cover off and visually inspected the saws\\' \"innards\" as best you can in the field like that with nothing to work on... Nothing appeared loose or leaking - it just refuses to run. I\\'m unsure what to do with this thing now as I called a Husqvarna shop and they just told me to follow the starting instructions exactly every time. Unfortunately, we were doing that to no avail. They told me they would be happy to look at it for a \"diagnostic fee that is not covered by your warranty. If, after diagnosis, the fault is found to be with the saw, then the repairs will be covered under your warranty. But the shop time to diagnose is not.\" I truly hope that this is just an aberration and that this one happens to be a lemon - it does happen. I pray this is not the current state of affairs for Husqvarna. And the warranty - if it can be called as such - really leaves a lot to be desired. ', '5 Star Purchase. As like most people, I was a little concerned about buying a \"refurbished\" chainsaw. The one I got was looked brand new and the bar wasn\\'t even scratched. I put fuel and oil in it, it popped on the 3rd pull and then started and ran perfect ! Took it out to the woods a week later, same thing, popped on the 3rd pull and ran on the 4th pull. I let it warm up a minute and started cutting. It ran strong and without any hesitation. If mine is any indication of the quality of these \"refurbished\" saws, I would not hesitate to recommend them or to buy another one if the need arises ! ', \"Almost New. The saw looks virtually new. It had a bit of fuel in the tank, so I assume it had been started. The bar and chain were absolutely brand new. The bar has a roller tip, but I don't see a hole for greasing it. The bag around the saw seemed to be somewhat wet on the inside.. Read the directions when assembling. You have to remove a plastic spacer before putting on the bar, and the chain brake lever has to be pushed toward the handle. Then it's easy. Nicest saw I've used, and I have used several over the last 50 years. \"]\n",
      "[\"The perfect saw for the farm. Bought this saw a couple of weeks ago and have used it pretty thoroughly since. I have had no problems or complaints, fires right up and has all the power that you need for felling and chunking. The quick adjust chain tensioner is very nice and starts and pulls easy, as you'd expect from a new name brand chainsaw. It's slightly heavier than some comparable saws from husqvarna, but it more than makes up for that in ease of use and overall quality. If you own a farm or heat with wood this is the saw you want. I've used a lot of husqvarna chainsaws over the years and in my opinion this saw blows them out of the water. I must also recommend buying the 13 dollar six pack of mixing oil to double your warranty from 1 year to 2 years. All in all I am highly impressed so far and expect this saw to last me for a long time. Less\", \"Great Saw. Pretty much the total package. Fells, bucks, and clears brush with ease.

      "['A Beast of a Chainsaw. I went to my local small engine repair shop in order to purchase a used chainsaw. He Told me that if I don\\'t use a chainsaw on regular basis and if it\\'s only Going to be used for clearing small Trees he suggest that I purchase a electric chainsaw. He told me that gas chainsaws have a tendency to leak oil and also have problems if they sit for an extended of time. He told me that electric chainsaws were a lot cheaper and if they stop working that you weren\\'t out hundreds of dollars and that the only thing you had to worry about is making sure that it had a sharp and chain and the appropriate amount of chain oil. I went online and did a little research and found the Oregon 15 AM 18\" chainsaw.I was not in anyway shape of form disappointed. This song is awesome.I initially used it for cutting small trees but over the last year, due to wind, approximately 6 good sized trees have fallen and have had to be cut up. I was initially concerned about the performance of the saw so but I have to say that it performed way, way better than I thought it would.There were times when I was cutting for hours at a time and the saw performed beautifully. The saw was not loud so you won\\'t have to worry about disturbing neighbors and you don\\'t have to worry about getting the proper mixture or dealing oil leaks. Take in to consideration the fact that you will need a heavy duty Extension cord and also do a little research on the length of the cord, amperage of the cord, and how far away from the power source you\\'ll be using the saw. From this point on I will only purchase Oregon chainsaws and will only use electric. ', \"Buy the RIGHT ACCESSORIES and PARTS. This saw replaces a HomeLite 16 inch unit that had no chain brake and, believe it or not, plastic bucking spikes. Ditching it because the bottom spike cracked off. It could cut and had a lot of torque, but the construction of this Oregon 18 inch unit is far superior with metal bucking spike, chain brake, and PowerSharp.. Price is pretty remarkable for what you get, but TOTAL COST may be about twice the cost of the saw itself, after you get items below.. Web sites are not clear about compatible chains:. - PS62 PowerSharp is the ONLY CHAIN that will work. It comes with a sharpening stone.. - S62 AdvanceCut is completely different and will NOT WORK, although specs are nearly identical.. BAR is same for both chains - this number is printed on it:. 180SDEA041. You can buy PowerSharp 18in 62DL Starter Kit with spare bar, PS62 chain, and stone. Or just PS62 chain + stone. You should keep a spare bar, because stores don't have them in stock.. This is a 15AMP saw. You need an EXPENSIVE HEAVY DUTY 12/3 15AMP outdoor extension cord, which is good up to 100 feet. Medium duty cords rated for 10 or 13 amps will cause overheating and poor performance and may burn out motor.. Price for 12/3 SJTW will be between 50 cents and 2 dollars per foot. I found 80 foot SJTW for less than 40 dollars.. Cords have RATINGS:. - you need 12AWG with 3 conductors - 12/3. - SJTW - heavy duty thermoplastic rated for weather. - SJOOW - heavy duty rated for oil and weather. Still waiting for cord to arrive, so have not yet tested cutting. I never used to sharpen chains, so looking forward to seeing sparks fly when I press the PowerSharp button. The TEETH on this chain look like carbide eagle claws. And chain brake will save time formerly wasted waiting for spin down.. Saw looks nice. wear good gloves handling it because chain is wicked sharp. Comes with a scabbard to cover chain when in storage. Comes with small bottle of chain oil.. It comes ASSEMBLED so the box is really awkward shape and hard to open. Chain is VERY TIGHT, maybe too tight.. Reading the manual should cure insomnia. \", 'Ordered this after a bad winter resulted in several large branches landing in my yard. With mos.... Ordered this after a bad winter resulted in several large branches landing in my yard. With most of them far too big for my little pole saw to handle, I started looking for an electric chainsaw, primarily due to cost and ease of use. After seeing that I could spend anywhere between $50 and $400 for a saw, and reading the reviews for several electric models, I landed on this one, thinking it was a decent middle ground. Also felt that since so many of the other saws call out the Oregon blade as a benefit, then an Oregon model was a safe choice.. Read the instructions carefully for first time use and for priming the oiler - instructions were clear, and initial set-up was easy and uneventful.. Got to work on the branches in my yard, and was impressed how easily this saw handled them. Largest limb was ~6\" in diameter, and this saw chewed through it like butter. Overall, I am very satisfied with both the quality and the power of the saw. Make sure you have the appropriate extension cord - I used a 14 gauge, 50 foot cord and connected it to my 3100 amp inverter generator - no issues powering the saw.. Haven\\'t used the sharpening feature, but it\\'s nice to know its there and available. Two year warranty is a nice bonus. ', \"I bought this after reading all the great positive reviews. I've just added another positive 5sta.... I bought this after reading all the great positive reviews. I've just added another positive 5stars.. Like another reviewer wrote, after reading the instructions, you have to prime the oiler for a minute or so WITH THE BAR and CHAIN removed. They even provide a small amount of bar & chain oil which is nice. That was easy but like another reviewer stated, putting the bar and chain back on takes patience for sure.. This is a VERY WELL DESIGNED electric chain saw. This saw is 100 times better than my last cheap electric saw with a reg. chain.. This saw ate through a bunch of Red-Tip hedge trunks like they were soft white pine. These Red-Tip trunks and branches are rock hard and solid and also very heavy! The teeth on this chain are aggressive and saw with an attitude for destruction.. Like another reviewer stated and per instructions, the blade has to be tightened shortly after using the saw for a couple of minutes. Then the tension has to be watched less and less but still keep an eye on it. I'm 63 and this saw made my chain sawing need SOOO much easier!. It's heavier than my old elec. saw but I had to use this Oregon 100 times less! After a solid 4 hrs. of saw or more, I thought the need to see if sharpening the chain would make the teeth like new. It does!. This has to be one of the best 100.00 I've ever spent on a tool for yard work.. I worked two afternoons in 97 degree heat sawing this old hedges trunks down and transporting the cuts to my neighbors yard. I called him first of course.. This saw made it possible. The hard part was wheel barrowing the cuts to my neighbors front roadside . My yard is the best it's been in 30 years or so. I didn't want to stack it up on my thick lawn 5 days before the City would pick it up.. Thank you Oregon for making this outstanding chain saw affordable to a frugal guy. \", 'This Oregon 18 in.

      "[\"For the homeowner that needs a chainsaw a couple of times a year, this saw would be hard to beat..... For the homeowner that needs a chainsaw a couple of times a year, this saw would be hard to beat. It is the easiest starting (hot or cold) 2-cycle engine that I have ever used. I only use the ethanol-free pre-mixed 40:1 gas. The Home Depot house brand works very well. Impressed with how little it vibrates and how the balance of it makes cutting easy and enjoyable. Make sure that you keep a sharp chain on it--from experience, only buy Oregon chains--they really last and seem to hold their edge better. A few weeks ago, I really hammered this saw when a huge pine tree came down in a storm. Parts of the trunk were over 30 inches in diameter. The kept going after hours and hours of cutting. Cutting the huge stump close to the ground was a real challenge that the Remington accepted and did well. Chain oiler works well when cutting and has an adjustable flow rate. Only thing I don't like is that the saw drips bar oil like crazy when not using it. At least the oil drips are confined to the bottom of the rugged plastic case. if you drain the bar oil before putting it away, the oil mess is a lot smaller. Without question, this saw is a great value and seems to be of very good quality. I have been using the saw for over a year now and would buy another one in a heartbeat if I need one. \", \"Quality chainsaw for the price point. My Stihl chainsaw had about seen it's last days and this c.... Quality chainsaw for the price point. My Stihl chainsaw had about seen it's last days and this chainsaw became available to own, so I decided to give it a try. After unboxing the saw and taking it out of a well made and heavy duty plastic carrying case, the first glimpse that it was going to be a quality saw was that the chain and bar were Oregon brand which are the top-of-the-line quality. The saw has ant-vibration built throughout and is well balanced when holding it. The recoil starter is spring assisted which will take some getting used to. Another feature that hints at quality is the chain oil flow to the bar is adjustable via an easily accessible adjusting screw on the bottom of the unit. Cheaper made and lower quality chainsaws do not have this feature. The Oregon bar has a quality greasable roller tip that will make the saw's chain cut easier. Unfortunately the saw does not come with a needle greaser and it is imperative that the nose is kept lubricated. I would suggest buying a good quality greaser and Home Depot has a nice one at https://www.homedepot.com/p/Blue-Max-Chainsaw-Grease-Gun-Tool-21134/303412777?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal1_rr-_-202519480-_-303412777-_-N . The saw has plenty of power for cuts up to 16 inch diameter. The saw does come with a tool kit and enough synthetic 2-cycle oil to mix 1 gallon of fuel. It should be noted that most of the regular fuel today has 10% ethanol (alcohol) added which starts to absorb water once you pump it and is only recommended to be used for 30 days, unless it has fuel stabilizer added to it. One way around this is to use a premium fuel that does not have ethanol added and using synthetic 2 cycle oil. For the occasional user that doesn't want to mix their gas and oil, the market has fuel in a can that has premium everything already mixed and you just have to fill the fuel tank. Home Depot also has this available https://www.homedepot.com/p/TruSouth-Trufuel-50-1-Pre-mixed-Fuel-Oil-6525638/202532877 or https://www.homedepot.com/p/TruSouth-TruFuel-50-1-Pre-Oil-Mix-6525606/205913129. I know that Remington says to use a 40:1 mix ration and the fuel-in-a-can is 50:1, but unless you are going to be running the saw under heavy load all the time, the premium 50:1 in a can will be fine ( read http://community.homedepot.com/howto/DiscussionDetail/501-vs-401-Fuel-Mix-906500000008bMB ), and 40:1 fuel-in-a-can is still available on the market.. The include Operator's Manual is excellent covering everything about the saw AND how to cut logs and use for pruning. \", \"Good Homeowner Chain Saw Two years ago a winter storm felled four 30+ year old pine trees in my i.... Good Homeowner Chain Saw. Two years ago a winter storm felled four 30+ year old pine trees in my immediate neighborhood, two of which wound up in my back yard and had to have someone come to remove them. I don’t need a chainsaw often, but when I do, I really do. I have a small electric chainsaw that is good for light duty cutting, but as the trees around my house get bigger, that saw no longer was up to the task. I also needed the portability that a gas saw provides. Then I found the Remington Outlaw. This 20 in gas powered saw is a beast compared to what I have and is more than capable of taking on these tasks and has a good price point. The saw being 20 in IS long, but I also plan to cut tree ‘slabs’ for some woodworking projects I have planned, so it is a bit of future proofing on my part.. The saw comes with a blow molded case and scabbard and I am glad it does; I like having its own storage. There is also a spot for a small bottle of 2 cycle oil in the case (which, by the way, Remington provides with the saw out of the box) and something they call a multitool, which is a screwdriver, wrench, and spark plug remover all in one (and it has its own space in the case as well). You do need to buy some bar oil before you use it. The scabbard disconnects from the case, so you can keep the chain protected as you carry it.. Remington provides one of the biggest, most detailed instruction manuals I have ever seen, with a LOT of it devoted to safety and how to use the saw. After some of the tool manuals I have recently gone through, this is nice. I don’t think there was anything that wasn’t covered in it. It even tells you how to sharpen the chain, if you decide you want to do that on your own. I do recommend reading it before using the saw.. Tensioning the chain is easy; all you need is a flat head screwdriver (or the provided multitool). Since the multitool is a little big, I just carry a separate flat head screwdriver for on the fly adjustments while using the saw (tension will change as the saw goes from cold to hot). Saw started up pretty quickly the first time; I did not have to adjust the idle, but the instructions are pretty detailed, so if you do it should not be a big deal. It ran just fine and cut great: exactly what I needed. It felt good in my hands, and the vibration was not excessive (I had no arm or hand fatigue), but I only cut for 10-15 minutes at a time.. Saw is about the same weight/heft as other saws this size. The case however is big and almost as heavy as the saw, so the two together are pretty weighty. I am glad to have the case though, since I like the idea of having separate storage for it, and since all saws seem to leak some bar oil, it’s nice to have it contained (this saw has not leaked much yet).. There is a lot of hard plastic on this saw; it seems to be typical of saws in this category. I might be more concerned if I was using this saw on a constant and regular/daily basis, but for what I use it for, it will be fine.. Two real complaints: One is the choke; it just doesn’t feel right, kind of like you could break it easily. It is some sort of plastic and you have to really pull it out to get it to stay while you prep the engine. Thankfully that’s the only fiddling you have to do with it. The other is the chain brake: it works fine but felt a little stiff in its movement (this could be normal for saws but I just don't know for sure). It is also hard plastic and feels a little more flimsy than I would like, but for a homeowner and DIY’er like myself I expect it to be fine.. Bottom line: if you are homeowner and need a chainsaw for your annual or semiannual tree work, I recommend this saw. It is one of the biggest saws (chain and bar wise) in this category and should be good for pretty much all the tasks you need. It has a good build and price, and should last for many seasons. \", 'Lot of great reviews - wasn\\'t my experience.. After reading all of the great reviews, I bought one of these saws last year. Huge Mistake. Piece of crap. Barely cuts through any tree larger than a twig, even after changing chains three times. leaks an extraordinary amount of bar oil. Separately, the bar oil cap won\\'t tighten, as though it\\'s rounded out. Heavy and cumbersome to use.

This Remington \"Outlaw\" chainsaw may not be the most powerful chainsaw I have used in my career, but it is the cleanest burning. The 20\" bar does the job driven by the 46cc power plant. I know the new chain is a big part of the power this saw has shown. I have had no issues with this saw after getting through its first cord of wood. The 46cc engine is just as loud as any other 2 cycle powered saw I have used. This is a powerful enough chain saw to get through 33 inch diameter wood. And before you ask a 20 inch chain bar does not cut through 33 in material without moving the saw around the wood while cutting it. The saw never lugged down as it cut the cord of wood. The chips from this saw flew over the entire area just as any chain saw does. You still need your googles and ear protection as with any wood cutting saw. The Remington RM4620 does a good job cutting through either your cleanup or wood yard preparation for winter. You will see the wood piles cutting down as fast as you can put this saw through the stacks of wood. ']\n",

I like the 18\" bar that can make single cuts thru large trunk sections of wood. The saw is pretty lightweight in your hand, so you can cut up firewood for longer periods of time without getting tired. The oil reservoir holds a decent amount of chain lube. You can fill it and get to work without having to stop every couple of cuts to make sure you\\'ve still got oil. The 15 AMP motor is what sold me on this saw. It has the power to cut through everything I\\'ve used it on without bogging down. I\\'ve cut up two cords of hard oak fire wood so far. The patented chain tensioner is also a nice feature. It\\'s tool-less design lets you tighten up the chain by hand. If you\\'ve got an electric outlet within 90\\' of where you need to cut wood, give this saw a try. It\\'s a great option to a gas powered saw if you\\'re cutting up fire wood. Less', 'This is one tough saw that any homeowner should have. I needed to replace my hard starting gas s.... This is one tough saw that any homeowner should have. I needed to replace my hard starting gas saw and looked first at all of the top of the line chainsaws. So many complaints about hard starting even new! I looked at the WORX lineup and the 18” model seemed about right and at a fraction of the cost. Set up was easy and it was ready to go in minutes (read the manual first). The first limb I went to was 4” and it went through it like butter even using a 100’ cord. Plenty of torque to spare and I’m sure it would handle much larger tasks. It’s also much quieter than my gas powered saw and has nearly as much power. I highly recommend this chainsaw. And the best part is that it starts right up every time I squeeze the trigger! ', 'After a lot of research, I was expecting this chainsaw to be far above average, but my experience.... After a lot of research, I was expecting this chainsaw to be far above average, but my experience found it to be nothing special, for a modern electric chainsaw. The saw cut well, but fell short in three areas.. 1. The most impressive selling point of this model is an \"auto-tensioning system\", but there is nothing auto about it. From the saws manual \"saw chains will stretch. Check chain tension frequently when first used and tighten when the Chain (8) becomes loose\" in fact the full text for tensioning tells you to loosen the tensioning, each time, before tightening. This tool free tensioning system works fine, but it isn\\'t auto.. 2. I\\'ve used gas chainsaws for years and rarely had a chain jump the track, but the chain stretched quicker than expected and jumped the track, on this chainsaw. I can only attribute this to a poor quality chain. The poor chain quality was further supported by the chains drive links being damaged by impact from the drive gear. Good chains last for years, this chain lasted half a day.. This chainsaw proved the value of an electric chainsaw, where you can run an electric cord, but it was returned for the poor chain quality and lack of any special functionality. I\\'ve already ordered another chainsaw that comes with a high quality Oregon chain. ', 'Worx is very good chainsaw. I had two huge trees in my backyard. They grow15 ft tall and 10 ft wide. One tree is actual 7 trees grow together, with stump diameter of 32\". I used 8\" Homelite pole chainsaw to cut off tree branches. Then bought this Worx 18\" electric saw to remove stumps. Very powerful saw. The saw chain got dulled in about two dozens of cuts. Had to file the saw chain. If you have money and want to save time and save energy, just buy a new chain.. The chain will get loose from time to time. You would have to pay attention and tighten it as you go. Otherwise, the chain may get off and damage the bar. Auto tension may help, but still, for heavy jobs, you will have to check and tighten it manually from time to time. ', \"It's a great product works as good or better than my old gas one. Built rugged so I think it will.... It's a great product works as good or better than my old gas one. Built rugged so I think it will last a long time. I would have given it a perfect score except they document their product terribly. They tell you that the safety has to be in the upright position. When it comes to you it's about 5 degrees off of the perfect upright position. So it looks like it's correct but it won't run in that position. I returned one before I realized it with the second one. Once I made the correction it worked great. \"]\n"
